Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.3, Customer.io may Process Company Data as necessary to detect data security incidents or protect against fraudulent or illegal activity and to build or improve the quality of its products and services, provided that in the course of these activities Customer.io will not (i) permit any third party (other than Customer.io’s service providers or except as instructed by Company) to access Company Data or (ii) use the Company Data to modify or add to Personal Information it collected from a source that is not Company.

7.4.3.	**Notification of Additions or Changes to Subprocessors.** Customer.io will (i) provide an up-to-date list of the Subprocessors it has appointed upon written request from Company at https://Customer.io/legal/sub-Processors/; and (ii) notify Company (for which email will suffice) if it adds or changes Subprocessors at least then (10) calendar days prior to any such changes. Company may object in writing to Customer.io’s appointment of a new or changed Subprocessor within five (5) calendar days of such notice, provided that such objection is based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. In such event, the parties will discuss such concerns in good faith with a view to achieving resolution. If this is not possible, Company may suspend or terminate the Agreement (without prejudice to any fees incurred by Company prior to suspension or termination).

7.4.4.	**Liability for Subprocessors.** Customer.io will be liable for the acts or omissions of its Subprocessors to the same extent as Customer.io would be liable if performing the services of the Subprocessor directly under the DPA, except as otherwise set forth in the Agreement.

7.5.	**Personal Data Breach.** Customer.io will notify Company without undue delay of a Personal Data Breach affecting Personal Data Customer.io Processes in connection with the Services. Upon request, Customer.io will provide information to Company about the Personal Data Breach to the extent necessary for Company to fulfill any obligations it has to investigate or notify authorities, except that Customer.io reserves the right to redact information that is confidential or competitively sensitive. Company agrees that email notification of a Personal Data Breach is sufficient and Company will notify Customer.io if it changes its contact information. Company agrees that Customer.io may not notify Company of security-related events that do not result in a Personal Data Breach or affect Personal Data Customer.io Processes in connection with the Services.

7.6.	**Deletion and Return of Personal Data.** Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, Customer.io will (at Company’s election) delete (after providing Company the ability to download, pursuant to the Agreement) all Company Data (including copies) in its possession or control, save that this requirement will not apply to the extent Customer.io is required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Company Data, which Company Data Customer.io will securely isolate and protect from any further Processing, except to the extent required by applicable law.
